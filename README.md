Duck Simulation Program
This is a Java program that simulates different types of ducks with various behaviors like flying, quacking and swimming.

Usage
You can run the program by executing the main_duck.java file. The program will create instances of different ducks and call their respective methods to display their behavior.

Classes
main_duck
This is the main class that creates instances of different ducks and calls their methods.

Interfaces
FlyBehavior
This interface defines the fly() method, which is implemented by classes that can fly.

QuackBehavior
This interface defines the quack() method, which is implemented by classes that can quack.

SwimBehavior
This interface defines the swim() method, which is implemented by classes that can swim.

Classes
FlyWithWings
This class implements the FlyBehavior interface and defines the fly() method for ducks that can fly with wings.

FlyNoWay
This class implements the FlyBehavior interface and defines the fly() method for ducks that cannot fly.

Quack
This class implements the QuackBehavior interface and defines the quack() method for ducks that can quack.

Squeak
This class implements the QuackBehavior interface and defines the quack() method for ducks that can squeak.

MuteQuack
This class implements the QuackBehavior interface and defines the quack() method for ducks that cannot quack.

Swim
This class implements the SwimBehavior interface and defines the swim() method for ducks that can swim.

Float
This class implements the SwimBehavior interface and defines the swim() method for ducks that cannot swim but can float.

Drown
This class implements the SwimBehavior interface and defines the swim() method for ducks that cannot swim and will drown.

Duck
This abstract class defines the behaviors of a duck. It has three instance variables, one for each of the behaviors: flyBehavior, quackBehavior, and swimBehavior. These variables are initialized in the subclasses based on the type of duck. The class also defines the performQuack(), performFly(), and performSwim() methods, which call the respective behavior method of the duck.

MallardDuck
This class extends the Duck class and defines the behavior of a mallard duck. It initializes the instance variables with appropriate behaviors for a mallard duck.

RedheadDuck
This class extends the Duck class and defines the behavior of a redhead duck. It initializes the instance variables with appropriate behaviors for a redhead duck.

RubberDuck
This class extends the Duck class and defines the behavior of a rubber duck. It initializes the instance variables with appropriate behaviors for a rubber duck.

DecoyDuck
This class extends the Duck class and defines the behavior of a decoy duck. It initializes the instance variables with appropriate behaviors for a decoy duck.
